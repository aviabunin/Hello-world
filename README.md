I am writing an information system for the organization of the Ministry of Emergencies. I use Blazor, Mapbox, VS 2019, MySQL for the database.
I would like to learn how to write programs correctly... . 
Currently - learn how to use GitHub
Any advice - what to read, to see how to learn to write programs - thanks in advance!
At first I am reading MatBlazor and I would like to make the first steps in writing some control for Blazor

Somethink about me.

I studied at Moscow State University and then graduated from graduate school, after which I worked at the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics. I was engaged in programming for various information systems and devices, network administration, etc.
